belltown,"High-rise condos, swanky boutiques, and a trendy nightlife have helped Belltown earn its reputation as one of the hippest neighborhoods in Seattle.","We all know that Seattle has some major ups and downs (elevation-wise, of course), but no area was as steep as the region just north of downtown. After years of debating, city developers decided to do the most logical thing: remove the hill itself. The project, known as the Denny Regrade, took the better part of a decade around 1910 and trimmed back tons of earth, leaving the slope more manageable. Despite the new topography, growth didn’t happen as rapidly as hoped. Several businesses set up shop there, but instead of the grand hotels and skyscrapers there were car dealerships and warehouses.It wasn’t until the 1970s that Belltown got a facelift; the area was rezoned for high-rise residences with ample business spaces on street level. Young, trendy folks moved in and made their homes, bringing with them a unique culture that survives today.","Belltown has the second highest Walk Score in the city at 97 out of 100. What this means is: sell your car. You won’t be needing it. Everything you could conceivably ask for is available within the borders of this small neighborhood. And while the mere mention of the place strikes up my inner techno music (uhnn-tss, uhnn-tss), there is far more to Belltown than its nightclub scene. Even during the day, it’s the place to go if you want the newest, the shiniest, the trendiest.","Oh, where to start? The main ‘strip’ of Belltown is 1st Avenue, running parallel to the waterfront and on into downtown. Along this street, you’ll find a gaggle of places to stop: art galleries, clothing stores, home furnishing shops, jewelers, salons, and of course places to eat and drink.Some of the classic venues are The 5 Point Café, The Crocodile (closed for a while, but back by demand of live-music-lovers), and the very vintage Cinerama movie theater. Newer, highly popular additions include Dahlia Lounge, List (an Italian lounge), and Bathtub Gin & Co., a delightful speakeasy tucked in an alley. For a little fresh air, scope out the Olympic Sculpture Park to enjoy the many art installations by local artists, not to mention the view of Puget Sound and the Olympic mountains beyond."
broadmoor,"Broadmoor is a gated community on the east side of Capitol Hill. It is bordered on three sides by the Washington Park Arboretum, which only adds to its secluded and private atmosphere, plus it is home to the Broadmoor Golf Club.","Long before the area was settled, the Puget Mill Company snapped up this land and began logging the trees. Then, during the time of the development of the University of Washington, who wanted to create the arboretum, part of the land was traded for that cause in return for utility work for a new residential community. As a result, Broadmoor was made possible. Since then, more land has been gained to make the Broadmoor Golf Club.","The atmosphere here is a lot like you would imagine from a gated community; incredible houses (of which, according to Zillow, none are less than 1800 square feet), immaculate landscaping, and quiet, weaving streets. One of the charms of the neighborhood is the variety of house styles; there are no two that are alike, which is different from some other residential communities.","Broadmoor doesn’t have a business district to call its own, but that doesn’t matter because of its close proximity to the amenities in Madison Park, Capitol Hill, and Montlake. A quick glance at the community blog shows that they have plenty of events to get together as a community, from potluck dinners to a 4th of July parade. If you do end up living here, make sure to join the golf club, or at very least try and find someone you know who is having a wedding reception there!"
capitol-hill,"Contrary to what its name would imply, there is no capitol to be found in Capitol Hill. Unless you consider the neighborhood to be the capitol of cool, that is.","There are two stories as to why city officials changed the name from Broadway Hill to Capitol Hill. Some say that the original developer’s wife simply liked the way it sounded, while others think he hoped that the state would actually move the capitol to that area.In its early days, the neighborhood was certainly ritzy enough to be the political center of the state. Huge houses were built, which led to the nickname of “Millionaires’ Row” in one area. After World War II, a great number of apartment buildings were constructed, changing the demographics. These two cultures are still reflected today.","Capitol Hill is funky and fast-paced, with an endless number of cool blocks to explore and, unfortunately, a limited number of parking spaces. During the day, markets, boutiques, and salons are a big draw. Nightlife is hopping with clubs, bars, and music venues, and you’ll often find coffee shops that moonlight as cocktail lounges. Individuality and fashion statements are encouraged, and there always seems to be some sort of block party or community forum to encourage residents and visitors to mix and mingle.","Since the area is known for its music scene, make sure to check out a concert at one of the venues like Neumo’s, pick through a record store like Sonic Boom, or do the extreme and attend the Capitol Hill Block Party in July. You can also say hello to the Jimi Hendrix statue on the corner of Broadway and Pine. If you’re into film, see a movie at the Landmark Harvard Exit– aclassic building turned into theaters.Despite being one of the most densely populated areas of the city, Capitol Hill also has a surprising amount of green space, including Volunteer Park, Cal Anderson Park, and Interlaken Park, not to mention the Washington Parks Arboretum on the northeast corner."
central-district,"The Central District is on the east side of Capitol Hill and is considered one of the oldest surviving residential neighborhoods in the city. Throughout its history it has seen many changes in demographics and politics, but has recently seen a period of new construction and community improvement projects.","The area was first cleared for development in the mid-1800s. It was the ideal place to settle because of its close proximity to the business district. Trees were logged and cable cars were installed, and many homes and buildings were constructed that remain historical landmarks today.At different times, the area was home to different cultural groups. First were European Americans, then Japanese, Jews, and African Americans. The Central District was an area of racial tension during the Civil Rights era, due to housing discrimination. In the years that followed, the community united to restore peace while maintaining the neighborhood’s cultural heritage.","The location of the Central District—well, it’s very central, you see. It doesn’t have a big business district of its own, but it borders Capitol Hill, First Hill, and the Madison Valley, all of which are hopping with activity.The community is very proud of its diversity; a festival is held yearly to “strengthen community pride, integrity, and spirituality while promoting cultural diversity throughout the Central District.”. Other organizations, like the Central District Forum for Arts and Ideas, devote their time to promoting the arts and culture of the African American community.","The infamous Skillet food truck expanded to its first actual restaurant here in the Central District—make sure you stop in for some of their crafty cuisine (they have bacon jam—need we say more?). The CD is also home to one of the only Ezell’s Fried Chicken places in the city. There is no shortage of food from many ethnicities, from Ethiopian to Spanish to Vietnamese and Haitian.The Central Cinema provides a dine-in movie watching experience, showing classic films and hosting cartoon happy hours. Not only are their prices cheap, but you can order food and have it delivered right to your seat (or couch) in the theater!The Bon Odori Festival is held every year in July to celebrate Japanese culture: arts and craft fairs, traditional music, martial arts, and dance are some of the main attractions."
denny-blaine,This fancy-pants neighborhood located to the east of Capitol Hill overlooks Lake Washington. Don’t be surprised to see gated driveways and meticulous landscaping!,"After the Madrona trolley line was built in the early 1900s, two land developers bought nearby property and started selling it to the many people who were eager to move to the shores of Lake Washington. Can you guess what these guys’ names were? That’s right—Denny and Blaine. Even though they apparently couldn’t come up with a more creative name for the area, it still prospered. Nearly every lot had a view of the lake, and a chain of parks was built from the top of the hill on down to the water. Today, most of the original homes (and all of the charm) remain.","Denny-Blaine is a haven for those who want a quiet, well-kept neighborhood that’s still relatively close to the city center. It’s strictly residential, so you won’t find a lively business district or many day visitors here. What you will find are stunning houses along meandering streets that end in cul-de-sacs.","Though Denny-Blaine has no business district to call its own, there is plenty to do in the surrounding neighborhoods like Madrona and Madison Park. Both of these areas are home to upscale restaurants and shops.What Denny-Blaine is really known for is its parks. There are three tiny ones within the confines of the neighborhood; one right along Lake Washington, one with its own pond, and a third, Viretta Park, that is just grass and a cool staircase is also sometimes referred to as Kurt’s Park (after Kurt Cobain, who used to live nearby). There is not much to see in Viretta Park, but the two benches are covered in tributes to Kurt Cobain."
downtown,"There is more to Seattle’s downtown than tall buildings and Pike Place Market. With its rich history and vibrant culture, Downtown is a cool place to live, too.","The original Downtown looked a lot different than it does today; wooden buildings, a saw mill, steeper hills. Two major events changed it all: the Seattle fire of 1889, which burned most of Downtown to the ground, and the Denny Regrade, a thirty-year-long project that tamed the slopes of Denny Hill. Add in the major growth of skyscrapers, roadways such as I-5 and the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and the Seattle Center, and you’ve literally got a city that has rebuilt itself out of the ashes.Many historic landmarks have been preserved however, like the Smith tower, Pioneer Square, and Pike Place Market. You can still take a tour of “underground Seattle” to see the remarkable still-intact structures that were just covered up and built on top of after the fire.","To say that the vibe here is “lively” seems like an understatement. Dynamic? That’s closer. Exuberant? Better still. Whatever word you choose to describe it, Downtown is the place to be if you want nonstop activity, love being surrounded by interesting people, and want to see something new every day. Obviously, there are major events going on here regularly, but it’s just as easy to find your own little hideaway that only a resident would know about.","This part shouldn’t be hard, but it is. How can we boil down the busiest neighborhood in the city to just a few recommended activities? Especially when they’re always changing, after all, and there are as many things to choose from as there are different tastes in hobbies?We could state the cultural stuff, like the Seattle Art Museum or the Symphony at Benaroya Hall. There are theaters and performance halls for every type of entertainment—the Paramount, 5th Avenue Theater, and the Showbox, just to name a few.Or we could mention the retail scene. If shopping is your thing, Westlake Center and Pacific Placehave a mix of high-end and regular retailers, not to mention all of the one-of-a-kind boutiques and home furnishing stores that line any given street in the area.Then there’s the touristy stuff. If you’re into sightseeing, spend an afternoon on the piers on the waterfront, or maybe take a tour on an Argosy cruise boat or at Let’s Go Sailing. The Smith Tower offers rides up to the observation deck so you can see the view of the whole city."
eastlake,"Which lake, you ask? I know, neighborhood namers really need to be more specific sometimes. Those ‘in the know’ are well aware that this cool neighborhood is right on the eastern side of Lake Union, which puts it at a prime location. Heck, you can even live in a houseboat if you want!","This area once played a big role in moving cargo from Elliot Bay and Downtown across Lake Washington. Most of the residents were people who worked in these important jobs. Once the city’s population began to grow, nicer homes were built for more wealthy dwellers, though they probably didn’t enjoy the nearby power plant’s seven smokestacks.It’s amazing to think that the first houseboats were more like “floating shanties” for migrant workers who helped to build the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Today, the residences are still small, but vary from modest to opulent.","For the past few decades, it’s been like one long episode of “Extreme Makeover: Neighborhood Edition” in Eastlake. Almost 60% of the residences there were built after 1980, most of them the kind of five-story apartment buildings with retail space on the ground level. It has probably the most eclectic, if not unusual, assortment ofarchitecturein Seattle, with floating homes, urban condos, turn-of-the-century homes, modern townhomes and old brick apartment buildings.This makes the area very fun and lively, both for residents and those who want to visit.","Obviously, there are lots of ways to get out and enjoy Lake Union here. There is a boat launch for kayaks and canoes, or you can join the Lake Union Crew squad. Many small parks dot the shore, including Fairview Park and Eastlake Bouledrome, which claims to have the best waterfront bocce ball in Seattle (though we can’t imagine there’s much competition for that title).It’s always fun to grab a table on the deck at one of the restaurants along the lake (like Eastlake Bar and Grill or Serafina) so you can watch the boats and seaplanes. If you’ve got the time, you can go on your very own seaplane ride and get a great view of Seattle, and Eastlake of course!"
first-hill,Guess which was the first hill to be inhabited after Downtown was all filled up? Yup. First Hill.,"Seattle’s elite were the original residents of First Hill, since they wanted to be close enough to all of the action of downtown but still have their privacy. Names like Haller (Haller Lake), Frye (Frye Art Museum), Carkeek (Carkeek Park), and Boeing (no description necessary) are some of the most familiar.The neighborhood was also once called “Profanity Hill” because of the exhausting hike from downtown, and is commonly called “Pill Hill” today, due to the high concentration of hospitals there. Hopefully you find yourself in First Hill for a reason other than being hospitalized!","In keeping with history, the attitude of this area continues to be “stay close to the action!” It’s an easy bus ride or walk down to the business district, and an equally short distance to the also-bustling Capitol Hill. It has its own little section of businesses along Madison Avenue that provide plenty of opportunities for dining, shopping, and people-watching.","Hopefully you’ll never have to head to First Hill to visit a hospital, although they do give top-rate medical care. Instead, try taking a tour of one of the historic mansions to get a taste for what the area was like in its early days. Or, view some classic paintings at the Frye Art Museum, which has the added bonus of free parking and admission! There’s always something going on at Town Hall, be it a concert, book talk by a published author, or community forum."
international-district,"Formerly known as Chinatown, the International District lies just south of the Downtown business district and is a rich cultural center with a vibrant atmosphere.","Since the 1880s, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino immigrants have called this area their home. At several points throughout history, the community faced challenges caused by racial prejudices and encroaching settlement. For example, after the bombings in Pearl Harbor in 1942, the entire Japanese American population was removed to internment camps, and in the 1960s, the construction of I-5 literally cut the neighborhood in half.Luckily, many leaders stepped forward to protect and preserve the neighborhood’s people and culture. Wing Luke was the first Asian American to be elected into the King County Council in 1962, and the Seattle Chinatown-International District Public Development Authority was formed in 1975 to improve housing and services in the area. Today, the neighborhood remains a hub for the Asian American population.","This is arguably one of the most unique and proud neighborhoods in the city. Festivals and events are easy to come by, and there are year-round opportunities for exploring the cultural heritage of the people here. Visitors and residents often join together for celebrations and the prevailing attitude is that, no matter what, everyone should feel welcome here.","One of the major draws to the neighborhood is the Uwajimaya market, a huge specialty store with every type of food imaginable and tons of Asian-inspired trinkets. You can also let someone cook for you and sample dim sum, bubble tea, Chinese tea, and bakery goods from traditional restaurants.We mentioned festivals before, and there are almost too many to list. Some of the main events featured on the neighborhood website include the Lunar New Year celebration, the Moon Festival, and Bon Odori, one of the most important Buddhist holidays of the year.Immerse yourself in the history of the neighborhood by visiting one of the local museums or art galleries. You can even take a guided historical tour through Chinatown Discovery Tours."
leschi,"Off the beaten path, once you discover Leschi you’ll wonder why you’ve never heard of this lovely neighborhood before. Maybe because those “in the know” want to keep it as their little secret.","Hundreds of years ago, you would have found hunting and fishing parties of the Duwamish Tribe “home-basing it” in this protected area on the shores of Lake Washington. These early tribes had cleared out trails from this idyllic lake location, radiating out to Elliot Bay and Lake Union.Leschi’s name comes from Chief Leschi of the Nisqually nation. Although originally friendly to the American settlers, he along with other Indians became entangled in a bitter land dispute that culminated with the “Battle of Seattle” in 1856. The band of Indians used this trail from Leschi to the outskirts of the Seattle settlement, attacking and burning settler’s homes along the way. They were met with a US battleship docked in Elliott Bay that returned fire and caused the Indians to retreat.Slowly over time white settlers and entrepreneurs began laying claim to the area of Leschi – building cabins, an “entertainment center” for hunting, boating, and nature excursions, a saw mill, and a boat launch for exploration of the lake’s eastside. Once a cable car line was established in the late 1880s, this area became fully developed.","Perched atop Lake Washington with fantastic views, a harbor and a sweet business district, Leschi has a very casual, laidback feeling. Close to downtown, the scenic drive out to Leschi puts you in a relaxed state of mind – far from the frenzy of the city.","This area has two main attractions – an extensive park system and a bustling retail area. Leschi and Frink parks are interconnected and span down the hillside towards the lake. Offering terrific views, manicured greenspaces, playgrounds, extensive hiking trails and boat moorage – you can explore from land to lake. The business district gives you several dining options – Daniel’s Broiler, BluWater andPert’s Delioffer water views and/or outdoor dining. Stop at Starbucks for a coffee or the Leschi Market for picnic fare and wander along the water or up into the neighborhood."
madison-park,"Since the early days in Seattle, Madison Park has been a destination for anyone who wants to enjoy a picturesque and chic place to spend the day. Today, the whole neighborhood has the same reputation.","The Duwamish tribe native to the area once used this area as their summer hunting and recreation area, and it didn’t take long for white settlers to follow suit. Within decades of the city’s foundation, Madison Park was created and drew vacationers with piers and a promenade, a boathouse, live entertainment, and even Seattle’s first baseball diamond. Once Madison Avenue was constructed and people could easily make their way to the area, houses were built like mad; everyone wanted their own personal view of Lake Washington.Today, a charming business district and the still-popular Madison Park beach are the pride of the neighborhood.","It’s hard not to feel a little fancier when you’re hanging out in Madison Park. The houses are beautiful, the shops and restaurants are classy and unique, and it’s far enough away from the city to make it seem like you’ve really gotten away on vacation. It’s also clear that the community is a supportive one; there are always events going on to honor local artists or give a nod to new businesses that have set up shop.","At the east end of Madison Avenue, you can find several blocks’ worth of shops, restaurants, and spas. You’d have to go back several times to get an appreciation of the variety of cuisines; there are French bistros (like Chef in the Hat), sushi bars like Nishino, a handful of pubs and alehouses, one amazing Tex-Mex place called Cactus, and a smattering of other staples, like pizza and Thai food.Madison Park Beach and the Washington Park Arboretum both offer great outdoorsy activities, like swimming, kayaking, hiking, or just stopping to smell the roses. Or, as in the case of the arboretum, the rhododendrons."
madison-valley,"Though it hasn’t always been considered such, Madison Valley is a desirable neighborhood in the middle of the Capitol Hill/Central area of Seattle. With tons of parks and a growing business district, this place has it all.","For decades, Madison Valley was simply an area that had to be traveled through to get to more interesting places, like Madison Park on the shores of Lake Washington. Because of its steep slopes that were prone to landslides, no one really wanted to build there. But as the lots near the water filled and more housing was built for war workers, Madison Valley itself eventually populated.Much of the area has maintained its natural beauty, and parks are practically a dime a dozen. Small, interconnected green spaces make their way down to Lake Washington, and the community is forever involved in protecting nearby habitats.","Because Madison Valley has only recently been given the respect it deserves, the attitude here is fresh with a “look at us!” kind of flair. The community has joined together to make their voices heard on issues such as safety, education, and environmental conservation. With a growing business district along Madison Avenue, the area is attracting more and more visitors, and residents are nothing but proud of their neighborhood.","Anyone who loves a good neighborhood stroll will adore the shops and restaurants on Madison Avenue. A French theme prevails, with places like Tallulah’s, Luc, Crush, and Voila! Bistrot. You can also hit up fun home décor stores and boutiques like City People’s Garden Store or Sugarlump for clothing “from bump to big kids”."
madrona,"Despite its close proximity to busier neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and the Central District, Madrona is an oasis of quiet and comfort. Its business district is small but classy, and the homes here are absolutely stunning.","Named after the native trees that covered the hillside, Madrona was the perfect place to settle for early Seattleites. One of the first attractions was Madrona Park, a lakeside swimming, boating, walking and picnicking dreamland. According to historylink.org, some people chose to camp in the park for the entire summer! Lots were quickly bought on the surrounding hillside, and eventually Lake Washington Boulevard was constructed so drivers could also enjoy the view of the lake.It is a diverse neighborhood, but there wasn’t always harmony between residents. During the Civil Rights area, racial tension was high and some violence even erupted. Thankfully, by the 1970s these issues were resolved, and once again Madrona is well known for its ethnic diversity and acceptance of everyone.","Madrona is the place to be if you want to live in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood yet still be within a stone’s throw of downtown. OK, maybe not a literal stone’s throw, but the residents do enjoy one of the lowest average commute times in the city, at 22 minutes. Wholesome family events are easy to find; movie nights, cultural parades, outdoor concerts, knitting groups, and wine tasting to name a few. This is a true community, with everyone working together to make it the best place to be. It’s no wonder they claim to be “Seattle’s best kept secret!”","There truly are some beautiful parks in Madrona. Windy, tree-lined roads make their way from the top of the hill down to Lake Washington, and hidden trails and staircases make the route easy for pedestrians. Madrona Park itself has a swimming area, picnic shelters, lots of grass and trees, and a reclaimed wetland area. The trail that follows Lake Washington Blvd is very popular for runners and bikers.The business district takes up about four blocks on 34th Avenue and Union Street. It may be small, but the establishments here seem to have been hand-picked to fit in with the neighborhood. Upscale shopping options include Hitchcock, Driftwood Consignment, and Glassybaby’s famous hand-blown glass votives. For food, try the Hi Spot Café for brunch, Café Soleil for traditional Ethiopian cuisine,or Bottlehouse for dinner."
montlake,"Sandwiched between Eastlake and the Washington Parks Arboretum, Montlake is a quiet neighborhood with ample park space. Because most of its homes were built before 1940, it maintains a charming old school feel.","In 1861, Montlake was known as Union City and was hoped to become a booming business town with shipping and freight opportunities. It didn’t quite work out in that way, but people did see the area’s potential for a beautiful residential neighborhood. In fact, land developers required a minimum dollar amount be spent on each new home constructed ($3,000 to $5,000 depending on where you were). People quickly snapped up plots with lake views, which were only made better after the Montlake Cut project was completed in 1917.","This is a community that rallies together to solve issues, usually revolving around environmental preservation. Hot-button issues include the ever-evolving debate about the Highway 520 bridge that cuts through the neighborhood, habitat restoration, and the upkeep of the area’s parks. Not that they can’t let loose and have fun. The community center hosts events like a fall festival, Minute to Win It nights, all kinds of sports and music lessons, and ‘tot’ programs for the little guys.","Much of the draw of Montlake is in its park system. Interlaken Park, which forms the border between Montlake and Capitol Hill, had some of Seattle’s first bike and buggy trails, which today make for great hiking. The Washington Parks Arboretum (which means, literally, ‘tree museum’), marks the eastern border and has flower gardens, trails that go over land and water, and a cool Japanese garden.The small business district on 24th Avenue has all of your basic needs—Fuel coffee, Mont’s Market (aptly named, wouldn’t you say?), pizza and Italian at Café Lago, and the standard neighborhood pub, Montlake Alehouse.Every September, the St. Demetrios Church holds their Greek Festival—one of the most famous events of the year in Montlake."
pioneer-square,"As Seattle’s first unofficial neighborhood, Pioneer Square is where the historic meets the 21st century. Seattleites recognize this area for its cool architecture and bustling nightlife.","Some of Seattle’s first settlers (pioneers, if you will) chose to build their cabins here, and the area quickly grew after Henry Yesler chose to erect the first steam-powered lumber mill on the pier. Tragedy struck on June 6, 1889, when the entire downtown went up in flames. Pioneer Square was, again, the place where rebuilding started. Many of these structures still stand today and have been protected from property developers by Seattle’s historic preservation movement.","Pioneer Square isn’t necessarily known for its residential appeal, although that is set to change in the next few years. A plan is in motion to build a large housing development in place of the north lot of Century Link field. This will bring not only hundreds of new apartments and condos, but retail and office spaces as well. In the meantime, the neighborhood still has much to offer in the way of art galleries, bars and restaurants, and various yearly events.","If you’re curious about the history of this great city, Pioneer Square should be your first stop. The underground tour is world-famous and takes groups of people under the streets to see a glimpse of Seattle’s past—the buildings and alleys that were buried after the great fire of 1889. You may also want to check out the nation’s smallest national park—The Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. This little-known museum will teach you all about Seattle’s role in the Yukon gold rush in the 1890s. Finally, head up to the observation deck of the Smith Tower—one of the world’s first skyscrapers—to see an amazing view of Seattle.For a more modern view of the neighborhood, head to Pioneer Square on the First Thursday of the month for their giant art walk. This free tour of pretty much any gallery you want to walk into has been going strong for over 30 years and is a Seattle favorite. In fact, many other neighborhoods have adopted the tradition themselves.If you’re hungry, try out Tat’s Delicatessen for their famous east-coast style cheesesteak sandwich. Late at night, try out Central Saloon. Established in 1892, this thing is Seattle’s oldest bar by a long shot."
south-lake-union,"Once home to blue-collar workers and a major industrial center of the city, South Lake Union has recently begun its transition into hip urban neighborhood.","In its early days, this region was where timber and coal arrived by barge from across the shores of Lake Washington and was further transported to Elliot Bay, where it went on to California and other places along the west coast. In other words, South Lake Union was instrumental in the growth of the city. Sadly, after most of the trees had been cleared, business declined and the neighborhood went through a depression. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and his Vulcan Real Estate have rapidly changed the deserted warehouse district into a thriving hi-tech hub. The addition of a trolley system, a new park along the shore of Lake Union, and retail/apartment buildings have, in recent years, given South Lake Union the feeling of a neighborhood again.","It seems that people can’t get enough of South Lake Union these days. Everyone wants to either live here, work here, or come visit. New businesses are opening daily, transportation options are improving, and hip restaurants seem to open almost weekly. Perusing the neighborhood’s website gives a glimpse into what life is like here on a daily basis—tons of events, buzzing press releases about the new amenities, and a great interactive map that shows all of your options for exploring.The neighborhood is quickly being dominated by local technology companies. Amazon.com’s new headquarters is in the neighborhood, and you’re sure to see thousands of Amazonians roaming the streets at lunch time. Other stalwarts like Microsoft and UW Medicine also have a large presence in the neighborhood, along with plenty of up-and-coming tech startups. (The authors of this site hail from South Lake Union.)","To learn about the history of Lake Union and the surrounding neighborhood, hit up the new Lake Union Park (finished in 2010). Here, you can visit the Center for Wooden Boats, learn how to sail or paddle a dragon boat, or take a class on carving your own wooden boat. Or, just frolic on the grassy knoll for the afternoon.As far as the other options for dining, shopping, and exploring, it’s really hard to know where to start. One of the best places to start would be along Westlake Avenue. Try the Dahlia Bakery for an amazing breakfast sandwich, or the Row House Café, which is built into a historic house. Once fortified, think about renting a scooter from Scoot About—there’s no better way to explore the neighborhood than on a cute little Vespa!"
bryant,"Bryant is an eensy-weensy little sliver between Ravenna and View Ridge, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in charm.",Sometimes this neighborhood is referred to as Ravenna-Bryant because of its similar history and timeline. The area was first settled when a rail line was put in along the western shore of Lake Washington and continued to grow when the University of Washington built its campus nearby. Bryant is special because it is the least infiltrated by businesses and is mostly residential.,"Bryant has a well-kept-secret sort of feel. It’s mainly residential and full of some extremely charming houses, but there are a few areas around the University Village and along 35th Avenue that contain businesses. This is a great place to be if you enjoy the surrounding neighborhoods but like to be in a quieter location.","At the southern border of the neighborhood, marked by 55th Street, there are several noteworthy places to investigate. Take the kiddos into Planet Happy Toys or to a fancy tea party at Queen Mary Tea Room. Partake in some self-care at one of the many salons and yoga studios. Finally, grab a bite to eat at the original Kidd Valley location, get drinks at Duchess Tavern, or get fancy and head to Pair for some French cuisine."
hawthorne-hills,"This small residential area near View Ridge and Laurelhurst offers amazing views of Lake Washington, Downtown Seattle, and the Cascade Mountains. It is charming and quiet, but in a great location for zipping to other parts of the city.","Hawthorne Hills and View Ridge were being developed at the same time, and each had their appeals. Hawthorne Hills hoped to outshine Laurelhurst with paved streets, public utilities, and sewers, but View Ridge did a little better job of advertising and attracting residents. In the end, Hawthorne Hills didn’t quite reach its goal, but the careful planning had a great end result. Nearly all of the homes in Hawthorne Hills are the originals, with some renovations in the past few decades.","People live the good life in Hawthorne Hills. Rolling, snaking boulevards give it a stress-free feel. And while there is no business district, none is really needed; the University District, Ravenna, and Wedgwood neighborhoods all have plenty of things to do and are within easy reach.","From the bottom of the hill, it’s easy to hop on the Burke-Gilman trail. Heading east will give you great views of Lake Washington and access to its beaches. Head west will take you to the U-Village and all of the shopping and dining experiences you could imagine."
lake-city,"Seattle’s northeast corner, an area known as Lake City, is divided into several smaller neighborhoods—Victory Heights, Meadowbrook, Matthews Beach, Cedar Park, and Olympic Hills.","Lake City has seen many iterations of itself, going from sleepy logging and farming community known to some as “Little Germany” to a seedy destination for many city dwellers during the prohibition era. After World War II ended, young families flocked here and the population exploded. Currently, residents are rallying together to focus on environmental issues and on drawing visitors back to its refreshed (and significantly more reputable) business district.","There’s something for everyone in Lake City. The area’s main thoroughfare, Lake City Way, bisects the neighborhood and is the best place to go if you want a bustling atmosphere. Newly constructed condos and businesses mingle with the retro establishments from years gone by. Farther out, the feel is more residential and quiet. Even though it is one of the most populous and spread out neighborhoods in the city, the community is close and knows how to work together to solve issues.","Some of Little Germany’s charm remains in Lake City—stop in at Kaffeeklatsch coffee shop and bakery for an authentic German pretzel (bretzl) or an apfeltasche (an apple turnover)! Really you’ve got your pick of any national cuisine—try Lake City Gyros, Erawan Bangkok Thai cuisine, Pacific Market for Persian, and round out your world tour at Ezell’s for some good ol’ southern fried chicken.Many beautification strategies have been employed in recent years, including several sculptures that appear at seemingly random places like in the medians on the roads. Of course you can’t miss the giant giraffe as you drive down Lake City Way. Plus, it’s not unusual to come across a large mural."
laurelhurst,"The neighborhood of Laurelhurst is every bit as fancy and meticulously maintained as the name would imply. The homes are large, the views are impressive, and safety and order are major priorities.","Laurelhurst has been enticing people with its beauty for as far back as we can see. The Duwamish tribe used the land as a seasonal campground, and early Seattleites would row across to the peninsula from Madison Beach, farther down on Lake Washington. Real estate developers recognized a good thing when they saw it, and soon the land was being cleared of its trees and being made ready for homesteaders. As the railway made its way north along Lake Washington, the area became even more popular. People who lived right on the water inherited an extra few feet of beach when the Lake Washington Ship Canal project caused the water level to drop. Today, residents count themselves lucky to have scored their own piece of this desirable neighborhood.Laurelhurst was one of the original suburbs of Seattle before it was annexed, and it has kept that same feel. The streetswind peacefully through the neighborhoodand homes are situated on little cul-de-sacs. If it weren’t for the views from the top of the hill, you wouldn’t suspect you’re in a large city. It’s easy to get to busier areas like the University District and even downtown. And even though it’s quiet, no way is Laurelhurst snobbish! This is a close-knit community where everyone is on the lookout for what’s best for their neighbors.","Laurelhurst is always good for a scenic drive to admire the houses, but if you’re looking for a little more action, head to Sandpoint Way. On the western end, you’ll find delightful little places like City People’s Mercantile, a hardware/home décor store, University Wines, and the Sand Point Grill. Closer to the University Village, there are many restaurants ranging from the fancy (Jak’s Grill) to the classic pizza joint, Varlamos Pizzeria.",
maple-leaf,"This place is every bit as quaint and wholesome as the name implies. Perfect for families and those who want to live in a tightly knit community, Maple Leaf is a gem of North Seattle, and has even been recognized nationally as a model neighborhood.","Like many North Seattle neighborhoods, Maple Leaf did not see much development until roads were able to better connect the area with the rest of the city. Slowly, residents began to organize themselves and lobby for improvements to the neighborhood. The community was so effective at seeing that their needs were met that they were nominated in 1986 for distinction in the Neighborhood of the Year contest by Neighborhoods, USA and came in 3rd place in their category!","Walking or driving through the neighborhood, you definitely get the feeling that this is a true community. “Welcome to Maple Leaf” signs adorn telephone poles, people are out walking with their babies or dogs, and when you go in a local business you are greeted with genuine enthusiasm. The Maple Leaf blog advertises nearby deals, alerts readers to community events, and educates about city-wide issues that may effect residents, with the odd missing-dog announcement thrown in.","The area around Roosevelt Avenue and 90th Street is the main business district in Maple Leaf. There, you’ll find much to keep you occupied. Hit up Cloud City Coffee for breakfast or a sandwich, and you’ll be equally likely to find some sort of community meeting taking place. Browse the kitschy store next door, Maxine’s—part florist, part gift shop. Roosevelt Ale House is a great place to stop for happy hour, or try Snappy Dragon for delicious Chinese fare.If you have kids, there are a few must-sees that your whole family will enjoy. One of the lesser-known treasures of the neighborhood is the Northwest Puppet Center, which houses a museum, a stage for plays, and holds classes for puppet enthusiasts of all ages. After you’ve exhausted all they have to offer, stop by Math ‘n’ Stuff and feast your eyes on their selection of games, puzzles, toys, and science kits. Run off some energy at the relatively new Maple Leaf Reservoir Park. The 16 acres of park land offer a viewpoint of both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, a series of rain gardens, shelter, sports court, ball fields, and a play area boasting both a zip line and children’s garden."
matthews-beach,"Ah, Matthews Beach! A neighborhood within a neighborhood. At the southern end of Lake City, this residential area is home to one of North Seattle’s most popular lakeside hangouts as well as some pretty swanky houses.","We can all thank the Lake Washington Ship Canal project for this whole neighborhood; without it, the area would still be a wetland. We can also thank John G. Matthews for homesteading here and loaning his name. Finally, the Northern Pacific Railway deserves a shout-out for becoming the Burke-Gilman trail, which wiggles its way up along the waterfront amongst houses and trees.","You can tell that the people who live here have a respect for nature. Houses are tucked into the shade of giant old evergreen trees and the Burke-Gilman is woodsier than in other parts of the city. Just south of the beach, the natural habitat has been restored to be friendlier to native plants and animals. And while the residential area is a bit secluded, it isn’t far to Lake City Way or Northgate where more of the action lies.","I bet I don’t even have to tell you what the main attraction here is. I’ll give you a hint: it shares its name with the neighborhood. That’s right, Matthews Beach! On those rare hot and sunny days in Seattle, this beach is packed with sunbathers and swimmers, and an ice cream truck is always passing through. It doesn’t even have to be hot – check out the park everyNew Year’s Day for the Polar Bear Plungewhere thrill seekers don creative costumes and kick off the new year right. The Burke-Gilman trail swings right through the park; take it north to admire the lakefront houses, south to get more of a nature feel."
northgate,"As one of the largest neighborhoods in north Seattle, Northgate has it all. It can be divided into four smaller sections: Haller Lake, Pinehurst, Maple Leaf, and North College Park (or Licton Springs), and has everything from a private lake to the world’s first mall.","It’s hard to imagine the Northgate area as it once was—a bog, inhabited by Native Americans and farmed for cranberries and other wild foods. Settlements crept in as they often do, and now we have Interstate 5, North Seattle Community College, and the Northgate mall in place of the original habitat.The mall is its own kind of jungle, however. And apparently this was the country’s first shopping center to be called a “mall,” so we should all take a moment to thank this neighborhood for revolutionizing our collective retail experiences. More recently, new housing and commercial complexes have been built, while at the same time work has been done to preserve and protect Thornton Creek, which runs through the neighborhood.","The region around the mall obviously sees the most action, and with the addition of the new condo complex and movie theaters, the area has even more appeal to potential residents. Maple Leaf has a tight-knit community kind of feel, while North College Park is a little more laid back, what with all the students and all. Haller Lake sees its fair share of activity, especially along its border at Aurora Avenue. Pinehurst is probably the quietest of them all, particularly on the north end.","Just for a minute, let’s pretend the mall isn’t there (sad, I know). What would you do in Northgate if there were no Nordstromor Target? Well, you could go golfing at the Jackson Park Golf Club. You could pick one of the many parks and hit up the swing sets or grassy knolls. You’re going to want to pop into holes-in-the-wall like Jebena Café, BurgerMaster, Gyro Hut, Bark! Espresso, or Boud’s Pinehurst Pub.Finally, book a spa day at one of the many salons—there are even some for dogs, too!"
ravenna,"Ravenna Boulevard meanders from Green Lake, past the University District, and on to the east toward Lake Washington. The charming neighborhood that takes its name from this street is the perfect place to call home.","Ravenna was once known for its wilderness—the creek that flowed into Green Lake and the forest of massive trees to be specific. City expansion would divert the water and turned the creek bed into what is now Ravenna Boulevard. The trees were gradually removed to make way for houses, but many still remain in the ravine at Ravenna/Cowen Park.","This is a remarkably quiet neighborhood, considering how close it is to the hubbub of the U-District and Greenlake. In fact, that’s a good way to describe the general vibe here: kind of, ‘We want to be in on the fun, but we don’t want it to keep us up at night.’ A small stretch of 65th Street near 20th Ave NE provides just enough activity to entertain the residents and draw in a few outsiders for a visit. Ravenna is also proud to call the University Village—aka “U-Village” shopping center part of its family; it’s one of the biggest attractions of the area, not to mention of the city in general!","The average person’s first stop when visiting Ravenna is at the U-Village. This outdoor mall is home to many stores that you would usually only see in the downtown area of a city—J. Crew, Anthropologie, Banana Republic, and H & M to name a few. It also has your more basic stops, like Gap, Barnes and Noble, and Eddie Bauer. This is a Young Mother’s paradise, with a play area, tons of cute shops geared toward children, and every child’s fantasyland, Trophy Cupcakes. In the summer, the Village closes off one of its parking lots for outdoor evening concerts, and in the winter there are umbrellas stationed handily at business entrances for you to use in between stores.Ravenna Park is also a worthy destination. At first glance, it seems like just a grassy field with some play equipment, but there are actually almost 50 acres of wooded land and many trails that meander through the ravine and connect to Cowen Park near the University District. Use one of the outdoor grills and covered picnic areas for a family outing, or bring your Frisbee or hula-hoop to pass the time like the locals do!"
roosevelt,"The Teddy Bear isn’t the only great thing that’s named after the wonderful Theodore Roosevelt; this neighborhood is, too! If that weren’t proof enough of its awesomeness, consider its central location, happening business district, and adorable houses the icing on the cake.","Roosevelt developed at the same time as nearby Ravenna, attracting residents as the University of Washington and Green Lake neighborhoods expanded. After Ravenna Park was built, President Roosevelt visited, and one of the landowner’s wives named the biggest tree in the park after him. The tree was cut down, but the name stuck around. The local high school also bears his name, as well as the main thoroughfare and one of the building developments.","Roosevelt is a little peppier than Green Lake and Ravenna, and a little less so than the University District. The intersection of two busy streets—Roosevelt Way running north to south, and 65th Street running east to west—forms a lively business district. The surrounding blocks have a mix of newer apartments/condos and original homes from the early 1900s. It’s a great neighborhood to enjoy on its own and is centrally located to give you easy access to other parts of the city.","It’s not hard to find something to do in Roosevelt. We like Rain City Burgers for their all-natural beef patties and yummy milkshakes. To go the true natural route, try Sunlight Café’s vegetarian menu—or just shop at Whole Foods! Casa Patron on 65th serves up decent Mexican grub, the buffet at India Bistro is definitely popular with the locals or opt fora savory pie at Pies and Pints farther up on 65th.Roosevelt also has a unique concentration of high-end audio shops. I’m going to chalk this one up to the university nearby and a higher than average concentration of audiophiles in the area. If you want to blow a few paychecks on some sweet audio equipment, stores like Definitive Audio, speakerlab or Magnolia Audio Video will be happy to help.Once you’ve stuffed yourself, do a little shopping at the many boutiques, consignment shops, and bookstores that are unique to the neighborhood. Finally, take a stroll through Cowen Park—you’ll be surprised at its size and how “away from it all” it feels there!Roosevelt also has a small, yet fun bar scene with a little something for everyone.Most of them are easy going, laid back pubs, but the Scarlet Tree has live music/DJ and somewhat of a hip-hop scene. The Atlantic Crossing can get pretty rowdy during Sounders and EPL games, whileTeddy’s is the one-stop shop for all sports TV games (plus they partner with Rain City to deliver burgers there directly)."
university-district,The University of Washington campus and the surrounding area is a magnet for the twenty-something crowd in Seattle. But don’t be fooled—you don’t have to be a student to enjoy this lively and funky neighborhood.,"When this land was first reserved as a potential site for a university or even an industrial center, the land developer called it Brooklyn, comparing the area to Brooklyn, New York, because of its position across the water from the main part of the city. Once the UW was established in 1895, people began referring to the area as University Station, and gradually the name Brooklyn fell by the wayside.The University of Washington was the site of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in the early 1900s, which led to the development of many new buildings, businesses, and the general beautification of the landscape. Much of the architecture still remains on campus, and the developers had the foresight to keep the view of Mt. Rainier unobstructed in many places. University Avenue was the center of the action for visitors. If you’ve been to ‘The Ave’ recently, you know that this phenomenon hasn’t changed in the past 100 years! Nor, probably, will it ever.","True to the predictions of its developers, the University District really is a ‘city within a city.’ It is a hub for public transportation (and just wait until the light rail arrives in a few short years!), has its own shopping center in the University Village, and houses a ridiculous number of ever-changing restaurants, bars, and shops along The Ave. Suffice it to say that there are enough things to do to keep thousands of college students busy at all hours of the day and night, year-round.","Even if you’re not a student, or in your twenties, the U-District still has tons of stuff that might appeal to you. The University Farmers Market runs year-round and is a great way to spend a Saturday morning. Pick up some produce for the week, chat up the super-friendly vendors, and listen to the street performers play their fiddles or didgeridoos (there’s always something different)!Every May, the U-District Street Fair takes over the Ave in a “country fair meets urban retail corridor” atmosphere. People flock from all over the city to see live bands perform, sample food from local vendors, and peruse the crafts of local artists.Popping through at a less peak time also has its benefits. Take a walk through UW campus and check out the infinitely cool library building or maybe the Burke Museum. If it’s rainy out (not that it ever is), the neighborhood has several historic theaters, including theSundance Cinema and Varsity as well as the Neptune, which is transforming to a music venue in Fall 2011. The Historic University Theater specializes in improv shows.Hungry? Go to Portage Bay Café for breakfast—they have a ‘toppings bar’ for you to doctor up your pancakes and French toast any way you like! Get some Thai food at Thai Tom for lunch, but be prepared to wait in line for one of their six tables. In the evening, hit up the College Inn pub, which was built for the very same Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition that brought all the action to this neighborhood in the first place!"
view-ridge,"Perched on the top of the hill between Lake Washington and Wedgwood, it’s no surprise how View Ridge got its name.","This area used to be covered in trees, so technically there was no view to be had before the land was developed. Once the landowner decided to dabble in real estate, however, that all changed. Trees were slashed, lots were cleared, and suddenly Lake Washington and beyond were visible. The area was annexed into Seattle in 1942, and it wasn’t until 1988 that the last lot was finally sold and built upon.","This primarily residential area is definitely tranquil and well kept; houses have yards and streets have roundabouts. It’s a great place to be if you aren’t a fan of traffic and other city noise, though you don’t have to go far to run your basic errands; Wedgwood is just down the hill. Plus, if you’re the ‘club’ type of person, Sand Point County Club and View Ridge Swim and Tennis Clubs are both located in this neighborhood.","If a drive through the neighborhood is any indication, it seems that the main hobbies here are gardening, jogging, and playing tennis. There are at least two neighborhood parks with play equipment and sport courts, not to mention nearby Magnuson Park, the Burke-Gilman trail, and Matthews Beach for all your leisure needs."
wedgwood,"Although there seems to be conflict about whether it’s spelled ‘Wedgwood’ or ‘Wedgewood,’ most agree that this is a pretty great neighborhood. No matter where you go, signs on street corners proclaim that, “Wedgwood Welcomes You!” Why, thank you, Wedgwood! It’s great to be here!","The neighborhood first started its rapid growth during World War II, when a developer had 500 houses built in Cape Cod style to be used as housing for defense workers. This landowner’s wife had a set of Wedgwood china; hence the name (and true correct spelling). Throughout the years, Seattle’s first P-Patch was created, a large bog was transformed into a playfield, and Big Rock went from being a landmark for trails to a hangout spot for hoodlums to a nice spot maintained by local residents.","Wedged (har har) right in the center of north Seattle, this is a great place for families or anyone who wants a quiet and cozy atmosphere that’s still close enough to the action of the city. You’ll find modest houses that once in a while give way to pockets of bustling streets with shops and restaurants (nearly every block has a business that shares a name with the neighborhood—“Wedgwood Dental/Hair Studio/Broiler, etc.”) Strolling down 35th Ave NE is a good way to get a feel for the community, since this is where most commercial businesses are located.","A quick glance at the Wedgwood Community Center website shows that there is more to do here than it would seem. In the summer, they have outdoor movies. The PLANET:HOME sustainable living festival is held here every year. They’re currently building a community gathering place with an outdoor stage, and Dahl Playfield was recently spruced up to include a skate park and new play equipment.Several eateries are also worth mentioning—swing through in the morning for breakfast at Top Pot Doughnuts, have lunch at Grateful Bread Bakery, or try out Fiddler’s Inn for happy hour or live music in the evening."
windermere,"Located on the shores of Lake Washington, Windermere is an upscale neighborhood with great views and a private atmosphere.","Windermere developed alongside nearby Laurelhurst. Shortly after the native trees were removed, many moved into the area to try their hand at farming. This endeavor didn’t last long, as people recognized the potential for real estate development—especially suited for the wealthy. The neighborhood was annexed into Seattle in 1910, but it wasn’t for another thirty years or so that the area filled up with residents. Since then, little has changed. Windermere has kept the quiet residential feel that made it so popular to begin with.","The overwhelming feeling here is that of safety, security, and neighborliness. There aren’t many community events, and you won’t find a business district to appeal to visitors, but somehow when you’re there, you don’t feel like you’re missing out on anything. After all, when you have an amazing house with a stunning view, what else could you want?","Residents enjoy the amenities of a private park that has a playground, a ball field, tennis courts, and a lakefront beach. There is also easy access to the business district along Sandpoint Way, which has many options for shopping and dining. We like the always-good Pagliacci Pizza and the lesser-known Sand Point Grill.The Burke-Gilman trail runs right through the neighborhood, so if you enjoy biking, blading, or just a scenic stroll, you’ll have the perfect place to do it."
ballard,"Ballard has a rich history, but that doesn’t make it a has-been neighborhood. On the contrary, my friends! Ballard is respected as one of the hippest areas in all of Seattle.","Ever been driving along and seen “Free Ballard!” bumper stickers plastered all over the car in front of you? Well, here’s why: Ballard was once its own city, home to many people of Scandinavian descent who worked as fishermen, mill workers, and boat builders. The neighborhood thrived as the commercial district (aka Ballard Avenue) grew, and by 1900 it was the 2nd largest city in King County, with 17,000 residents. In 1907, however, the city of Ballard was annexed by Seattle because it was having trouble supplying its people with water and other services. That decision is still hotly attested by some. Hence the bumper stickers.","Because of its wide variety of residents, Ballard has a very unique personality. You’ve got the let’s-go-out-for-happy-hour crowd, the early-morning-market crowd, the trendy-shop-and-salon crowd, and the late-night-debauchery crowd. You can see it all in one spot–Ballard Avenue. This street was once the commercial district, but now houses about a gazillion restaurants, shops, bars, and art spaces. On one block, for instance, you can find the Smoke Shop (a complete dive bar frequented by fishermen), a self storage facility, a few of the trendiest bars in Ballard (Ocho, BalMar, and Volterra, for example), an architecture firm, and a music venue. Expand this example to Ballard as a whole, and you’ve got a pretty good idea of what it’s like there.","One of Ballard’s most-visited attractions is the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, which were built in 1917. Engineering buffs will enjoy the well-orchestrated mechanics of it all, and dreamers can imagine sunning themselves on the huge yachts that pass through. You can also go to the underwater observatory and watch the salmon swimming up the fish ladder on their way to Lake Washington and beyond.In the summer months, Golden Gardens Park is a major destination. It’s one of the few sandy beaches in Seattle, and you’ll find beach volleyball courts, kite flyers, sand castles, and barbecue pits. Sure, the water is still frigid, but on the right day you feel just like you’re in Maui.Every Sunday during the year, the Ballard Farmer’s Market is open for business. Ballard Avenue is closed down to make room for local growers and vendors, plus a variety of artists selling their wares, from jewelry to furniture. This is one of the few year-round markets in the city, and since the selection is always changing, it’s easy to make it a weekly stop."
blue-ridge-north-beach,"With expansive views of Puget Sound, one of Seattle’s best parks—Carkeek—in its back yard, and beautiful homes that were almost all built within twenty years of each other, the Blue Ridge neighborhood of north Seattle has plenty to offer. Just south of Blue Ridge and bordering another stunner of a park, Golden Gardens, North Beach is a little less formal than Blue Ridge, but has similar homes and views. The two neighborhoods are often lumped together as the Blue Ridge/North Beach neighborhood.","After he tired of building airplanes, William Boeing decided to dip his toe into the land development market. He bought up a large chunk of land in northwest Seattle and began the Blue Ridge project. Trees were cleared, houses were built, and the wealthy of Seattle moved in. Five of the first homes, which were occupied by Boeing executives, still stand today and are referred to by residents as “the castles.”","Though years have passed and new types of people have moved in, Blue Ridge has kept its reputation as an elite community. A fancy community club, pristine landscaping, and streets that have a private-access kind of feel further cement this notion.","Being a residential neighborhood, Blue Ridge doesn’t have a business district or many destinations to check out. Except, of course, for Carkeek Park. Over 400 homes back up to the ravine that has trees, hiking trails, and picturesque streams and bridges. The park also has beach access, an environmental learning center, and picnic and playground areas where the infamous Bubble Man is known to dropinto entertain the kiddies. You can also head down to Golden Gardens Park for an excellent beach, off-leash dog area or an evening bonfire.Swanson’s Nursery is another gem situated in the neighborhood. Any home gardener would be happy to spend hours exploring their selection of plants, both native and exotic. It’s also a favorite spot to visit in December with Santa visits, elaborate Christmas displays, electric train, and of course a chance to get your fresh-cut Christmas tree!"
broadview,"Broadview is a neighborhood tucked in the far northwest corner of Seattle, bounded by the Seattle city limits on the north, Puget Sound on the west, Carkeek Park on the south and Greenwood Ave on the east.Broadview is perched on a slope that overlooks the Puget Sound. Its name is pretty obvious, as many homes have sweeping views of the Puget Sound and Olympic mountains.","The Broadview/Bitter Lake area was once heavily forested, but much of it succumbed to the boom during the Klondike Gold Rush when farmers and logging companies cleared much of the land and processed the lumber at a sawmill operation on Bitter Lake.Development of the Broadview area was spurred by the Seattle-Everett Interurban trolley and later became home to the Playland amusement park/dog racing track/speedway in nearby Bitter Lake.Broadview was annexed into Seattle in 1954. Playland shut down shortly after. It is now a popular residential area for Seattleites.","Broadview is decidely residential. While Greenwood Ave is packed with apartments, condos, townhomes and a few small commercial areas, everything west of there is a quiet neighborhood filled with single-family homes.Most homes were built betwenn 1940-1980, so it is one of the newer Seattle neighborhoods. As you might guess, homes in the flatter area to the east are modest and affordable. As you move down the slope towards the Sound, stunning views give way to fancier and pricier homes. There are even some gigantic estates tucked back in the forested areas.","The Playland amusement park at Bitter Lake is long gone, and this neighborhood doesn’t have many particular attractions except one truly exceptional one. Carkeek Park easily ranks as one of Seattle’s top parks. The park has 220 acres of watershed and forest with miles of hiking trails that culminate at the beach. Views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains are stunning. It is hard to resist living nearby this gem of a park.The main commercial area, like grocery shopping, is actually a little further south on Holman Rd in Crown Hill, but there are a few eateries of note. Bick’s Broadview Grill is an unassuming neighborhood restaurant that serves slightly upscale comfort grub with a spicy kick. Saltoro also has many local devotees for their Italian fare."
crown-hill,"Located just north of Ballard, Crown Hill has a small-town feel while still being attractive to up-and-comers in the city.","Ironically, the first residents of Crown Hill were–to put it gently–dead. As Ballard grew, officials requested to use a plot of land north of the neighborhood as a cemetery, and Crown Hill Cemetery was created. Real-live people were slower to move in, but after World War II the population grew exponentially. The architecture of the houses reflects the era, and you’ll find many single-level brick houses with nice front lawns. Another period of growth happened in the 1980s and 90s, bringing about the construction of many apartments, condos, and townhouses.","Crown Hill is a little oasis of calm between the busier Ballard and Greenwood. The feel among the residences is very small-town and peaceful, though the business district is quite active. It’s a very involved community, too, with constant opportunities to bond with the neighbors, whether it’s a community garage sale night, a park clean-up work party, or an Annual Night Out for crime prevention. Every year, residents in Olympic Manor team up to create a beautiful holiday light display that is a popular sightseeing opportunity for people all over the city.","Whether you live in Crown Hill or not, you simply have to go check out the light display in December. It seems to transport you back to a time when the world was a little less hectic during the holiday season, and it really shows how this community works together.Holman Road houses the business district, which extends easily into Greenwood and Ballard. Visit Dick’s Drive-In for quick and cheap burgers and shakes, or try Patty’s Egg Nest for Swedish pancakes on the weekend. Deeper into the neighborhood lies Swanson’s Nursery, a gardener’s dreamland, and just a small distance north is Carkeek Park, which has beach access and miles of hiking trails."
fremont,"Center of the Universe? Well doesn’t SOMEone have an over-exaggerated sense of themself?Fremont doesn’t get this moniker for nothing. They are, in fact, quite centrally located in the city of Seattle – located just North of Downtown and centrally positioned among most Seattle neighborhoods. Companies like Adobe Systems, Google, and Getty Images have chosen Fremont as their Seattle headquarters. With excellent restaurants, nightlife, a variety of living choices (homes, condos, townhomes) this is a great place to call home.","Flashback to 1891 and you would find 5000 early pioneers living here, with their own wood mill and a draw-bridge-free commute to downtown (this was pre-ship canal days, afterall). The early 1940s saw an end to rail and trolley service to the area, and sent the area into a bit of a lull. Neglect and low rents turned Fremont into an attractive option for artists and students in the 1960s – laying the groundwork for the funky and eclectic vibe still apparent today.","Come to Fremont if you feel the need for more excitement in your life. One glance at the neighborhood’s event calendar and you’ll see there is always a party here. The main business district has a huge variety of different eateries, a brewery, a chocolate factory, and access to one of the best sections of the Burke Gilman – right along the Ship Canal. Not to mention non-stop action at the Fremont Draw Bridge. There is a pretty decent hillside as you go up to 45th – so you can get a good calf workout as you take a deeper dive into the neighborhood to check out the gorgeous homes and off-the-beaten path businesses.","Fremont has a festival or event for all ages and lifestyles, including the Summer Solstice Parade (a colorful Mardi Gras-style parade with the famous rogue band of nekkid bicyclists), Oktoberfest, Outdoor Movies and First Friday Artwalk to name a few. Each Sunday, bargain hunters flock to the Fremont Sunday Street Market – a flea market / farmer’s market style gathering with food vendors too.In Fremont, you can take a tour of a chocolate factory, distillery, and brewery – all in one day! You can also grab an amazing sandwich at Paseos, eat a freshly made pie at Pie, slurp a bowl of Pho at Lucky’s, or sit down for creative Mexican cuisine and a killer margarita at el Camino.The creative vibe is still alive and well here, with great galleries, boutiques, an excellent statuary and garden shop, and a couple of antique stores.No one leaves Fremont without saying hi to the Troll, checking out what is accessorizing the Interurban sculpture , or blasting off the Rocket. What’s not to love about the Center of the Universe?"
green-lake,"True or False: Green Lake is a lake in Seattle.If you answered ‘True’, then you’re partly correct, but you have a lot to learn. Green Lake is way more than just a body of water, it’s a whole neighborhood!","Pioneers first settled at Green Lake in the 1860’s, and the area was annexed into Seattle in 1891. The water level was lowered in 1911 to form more park space, cutting off the water inflow and outflow routes. Now it is fed only by rain water and Seattle’s water supply. There is also a constant battle to keep the native algae from taking over (hence the name of the lake, by the way).Because of its close proximity to downtown Seattle and the great number of things to do there, Green Lake is a highly popular neighborhood. In the past 15 years or so there has been a great deal of development–new condos and town homes, remodeling of houses, and many new businesses.","The general attitude in Green Lake seems to be  The people here love to get outside, whether it’s just to walk to the library or grab dinner, or head down to Green Lake park for a run. There isn’t a huge nightlife scene here, although you could take country line dancing lessons at The Little Red Hen or catch a live band on Friday nights at the Latona Pub.In general, the people are friendly and have an early-to-bed, early-to-rise lifestyle.","The obvious landmark here is that of the lake itself. The most popular activities include walking or jogging around the 2.8-mile track, renting kayaks, or playing in one of the many sports leagues that meet here. Also, if you happen to own a strange wheeled contraption, such as a unicycle or one of those bicycles-on-stilts, feel free to bring it on down! It might not be advertised, but we’re pretty sure there’s an unofficial contest for the weirdest wheels.But wait, that’s not all! Why not golf a few holes at Green Lake Pitch n Putt? Even amateurs can find success at this course. Or, if you’re feeling lazy, try checking out the hidden Tangletown area. Once you’ve found your way through the maze of streets, you can grab a Mighty O doughnut, try the Seattle Dog at Hot Diggity, or have happy hour on the patio at the Elysian brewery.But wait, that’s not all! Some of the oldest institutions here are located right on the lake. The Green Lake Library, a gorgeous old building, has prime real estate among the posh houses that overlook the lake. The Bathhouse Theater, built in 1927, hosts plays put on by the Seattle Public Theater.That’s certainly not all, but we could go on all day. Most of the fun, after all, is finding your own favorite spots. Enjoy!"
greenwood,"Greenwood has risen from the bog of its past (literally!) to become a busy, family-friendly, affordable neighborhood.","Humbler beginnings are hard to come by. In its early days, Greenwood (then called Woodland) was known for its wet, marshy landscape and, frankly, its cemetery. As demand for land grew and the trolley lines made their way north, the cemetery was transplanted to Crown Hill and the building began. By the 1940’s, Greenwood Avenue was known as the “Miracle Mile” because of its plethora of shops, pharmacies, banks, restaurants, and even a department store. The bog threatened to swallow up some of the lower houses, but the annexation of Greenwood into the city of Seattle provided much needed infrastructure changes that kept the neighborhood from sinking back from whence it came.","Today, Greenwood’s business district remains as successful as it was decades ago. The area around 85th Street and Greenwood Avenue is booming with coffeehouses, antique stores, bars, and eateries, along with a community theater. The community hosts many events that appeal to families and urbanites alike. Things tend to quiet down at night, which makes this the perfect place to live if you like to be on the move during the day and a homebody when the sun goes down.","Let’s start with the major events that Greenwood hosts every year. There’s the Greenwood Car Show every June, and the beloved Seafair parade in August—complete with the Seafair Pirates and a synchronized motorcycle routine by the local police force. Monthly art walks showcase not only local artists, but give you a chance to tour all of the interesting businesses along Greenwood Avenue.The Taproot Theatre is still going strong despite being damaged in a fire in 2009. One of the largest mid-size theatre companies in Seattle, their mission is to “create theatre that explores the beauty and questions of life while providing hope to our search for meaning.” They accomplish this by putting on plays on their main stage, offering classes to budding actors of all ages, and by traveling to schools and clubs to perform on the road. They even have their own café now!Other worthy stops include the Greenwood library, newly renovated and a pleasant space, Top Ten Toys, one of the coolest toy stores in the city, and Green Bean Coffeehouse, which devotes equal time to making a great community as it does making a great latte. Try Mr. Gyros for a pita wrapped around something amazing, or go to Naked City Taphouse for a cold brew and yummy dinner. The latest hot spot is Chuck’s Hop Shop – proudly deemed “The Land of a Thousand Beers”. It also features a rotating schedule of daily food trucks – making it the perfect spot for a quick bite and a beer! And if you have a sweet tooth, the case of homemade truffles at Chocolati Café is sure to make your cavities ache for more."
haller-lake,"It’s hard to believe that a tiny lake could have an entire neighborhood named after it, but that’s a testament to the special feel of the private little waterfront and surrounding area.","Let’s call Haller Lake a ‘late bloomer’ of a neighborhood. No one really settled in the area until the mid-1900s; with the many other smaller neighborhoods nearer to downtown, there was no reason to. The majoring of households were on large plots of land with enough room far farm animals and orchards. The small lake, originally owned by John Welch and then bought by Theodore Haller, was the most desirable place to settle.A woman named Clare Huntoon saw potential, however, and purchased a bunch of land. Nothing much became of it as far as housing is concerned, but her land is now home to major businesses and community centers, ranging from Ingraham High School and Helene Madison pool to Northwest Hospital and the Evergreen-Washelli cemetery.Residents of the community have long resisted expansion and population growth due to their love of the environment and their disdain for traffic congestion.","The atmosphere in Haller Lake varies widely depending on where you are in the neighborhood. On its edges, near Aurora Avenue to the west and Northgate Way to the south, are the business districts (and the traffic we mentioned before). As you head towards the center, the activity fades and quiet residential streets take over. With larger plots of land than other places in the city, residents can spread out a little and enjoy the quiet.","Haller Lake itself has a ‘secret garden’ kind of feel; only one road lends public access, and the four or so parking spaces only further the sensation that you’ve stumbled across something private. The water has that glassy quality from being sheltered from wind and watercraft, and the small shore is perfect for a picnic or just sunbathing.Nearby Northacres Park is perfect for letting the dog out for some off-leash time on the woodsy trails, or bringing the kids for some wading pool action.Haller Lake also offers the only granite curling facility in the area. Grab a broom, join a team, or sign up for some practice time at one of their monthly open houses to try your hand at that newly-famous sport!"
loyal-heights,Nestled in the middle of Ballard is the Loyal Heights residential area. Poking around among the adorable homes here makes it easy to see why residents here would be loyal to their sweet neighborhood.,"Loyal Heights was first considered a suburb of the city of Ballard, before it was annexed into Seattle. It includes the area north of 65th and west of 15th Avenue, extending to Puget Sound, though sometimes the western part is referred to as Sunset Hill. The man who first developed the area had a daughter named Loyal. He must have loved her a lot, because he not only named the neighborhood after her, but also Loyal Beach and the local trolley line. (As a side note, you have to wonder how is other daughter, Priscilla, felt about all of that!)Nearly all of the residences here are homes that were built before the 1960s, which only adds to the old-school charm of this neighborhood.","Life seems to slow down when you enter Loyal Heights. Away from the organized chaos of Ballard, it’s easy to relax and enjoy the view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Yet, because of its location, you don’t feel disconnected from the city, either. The area around 15th Avenue is the busiest, and as you head west and down toward the water, things get more and more calm.","Along the main streets of 15th Avenue and 80th Street, there are many places unique to Loyal Heights. Around the intersection of 80th and 24th, Larsen’s Bakery is famous citywide for its traditional Danish Kringle, and the nearby Fresh Fish Company and Italian Meat Market can help round out your meal planning for the week.If you’re looking for something a little more out-of-the-ordinary, why not stop by Zen Dog Studio & Tea House Gallery, where you can meet the owner (aka Zen Dog), sip tea, and view the Asian artwork collection? Or sign up for a class at Pole for the Soul where you can channel your inner pole-dancer."
magnolia,"There’s a lot going on in this neighborhood: waterways, railways, golf course, military fort, beaches, and tremendous views all the way ‘round.","In its early days, Magnolia wasn’t a very popular place. The land wasn’t great for farming and it was hard to get to, being a peninsula and all. One very smart man, however, saw potential. “Hmm,” Dr. Henry Smith probably said to himself, “Here we’ve got this great downtown area, some low-lying land perfect for a rail line, and nearby a nice little cove. I’m gonna buy me that cove and make a killing in the shipping industry!” And that is what he did, though it took 40 years before the train actually got there. Magnolia became a major trade post, bringing goods in from across the Pacific. (Today, Smith Cove is a cruise ship terminal, which is equally important!)It didn’t take long before the roads improved, and people could settle in the hills of Magnolia. The military built Fort Lawton on the northwest section of the peninsula. At its prime 20,000 soldiers were stationed here, but after the Vietnam war, 85% of the land was sold to the city. Discovery Park was created, giving us the biggest park in the entire city.","Because it’s on a peninsula, Magnolia has a secluded feel. Looking at the neighborhood from outside, you might think there isn’t much more there than houses and a marina. Wrong! The area around McGraw Street and 34th Avenue W is a little pocket of activity, with aWalk Scorerivaling that of Fremont or Greenlake. A glance at the neighborhood’s blogshows that there’s always something going on here, be it a farmer’s market, the yearly SummerFest celebration, a free nature walk at Discovery Park, or a spur-of-the-moment community outreach event.Not to be left out is Fisherman’s Terminal, located right on Salmon Bay near the 15th Street Bridge. Here, you can walk around on the docks and admire the real-life fishing boats, then stop in at the market tobuy the seafood caught that very day. Though not as famous as the Pike Place Market, rumor has it that this is an even better way to experience the local fishing culture.","Discovery Park is one of the biggest lures that Magnolia offers. Its offerings run the gamut from hiking trails to tide pools, with streams, meadows, and sandy beaches in between. The greatest part of the park is their dedication to nature education; throughout the year you can attend classes to learn about the flora and fauna native to the region—bird watching and low tide walks are some of the most popular. Also located in Discovery Park is the Daylight Star, a Native American cultural center complete with conference center, facilities for pow wows, and an art gallery.If you prefer the neighborhoody over the outdoorsy, try visiting the cluster of blocks around McGraw Street and 34th Avenue West. It’s something you have to stumble across, but once you’re there you’ll be set for the day. In the summer, this is the spot of the Saturday farmer’s market. Or come through any day or season and visit the plentiful cafes, salons, boutiques and bakeries. Food options include Hawaiian, Mexican, sushi, Italian, sandwiches, Thai, pub grub…anything! The community pool and library are also big hits with the kids."
blue-ridge-north-beach,"With expansive views of Puget Sound, one of Seattle’s best parks—Carkeek—in its back yard, and beautiful homes that were almost all built within twenty years of each other, the Blue Ridge neighborhood of north Seattle has plenty to offer. Just south of Blue Ridge and bordering another stunner of a park, Golden Gardens, North Beach is a little less formal than Blue Ridge, but has similar homes and views. The two neighborhoods are often lumped together as the Blue Ridge/North Beach neighborhood.","After he tired of building airplanes, William Boeing decided to dip his toe into the land development market. He bought up a large chunk of land in northwest Seattle and began the Blue Ridge project. Trees were cleared, houses were built, and the wealthy of Seattle moved in. Five of the first homes, which were occupied by Boeing executives, still stand today and are referred to by residents as “the castles.”","Though years have passed and new types of people have moved in, Blue Ridge has kept its reputation as an elite community. A fancy community club, pristine landscaping, and streets that have a private-access kind of feel further cement this notion.","Being a residential neighborhood, Blue Ridge doesn’t have a business district or many destinations to check out. Except, of course, for Carkeek Park. Over 400 homes back up to the ravine that has trees, hiking trails, and picturesque streams and bridges. The park also has beach access, an environmental learning center, and picnic and playground areas where the infamous Bubble Man is known to dropinto entertain the kiddies. You can also head down to Golden Gardens Park for an excellent beach, off-leash dog area or an evening bonfire.Swanson’s Nursery is another gem situated in the neighborhood. Any home gardener would be happy to spend hours exploring their selection of plants, both native and exotic. It’s also a favorite spot to visit in December with Santa visits, elaborate Christmas displays, electric train, and of course a chance to get your fresh-cut Christmas tree!"
phinney-ridge,The Ridge that runs across the hilltop separating Ballard and Green Lake is enjoying a surge of new family friendly stops along the bustling Phinney / Greenwood Avenues. This ‘hood offers the ultimate in playgrounds – the Woodland Park Zoo.,"One of the earliest residents west of Green Lake was the wealthy Guy Phinney, who had his own private estate on the crest of the hill (which would later become Woodland Park and the Zoo). As the area immediately surrounding Green Lake filled with residents and the sawmill there worked its way through the nearby trees, people took advantage of the newly cleared land and moved in. Mr. Phinney encouraged more settlers by putting in his own trolley from Fremont to the area. As more transportation lines were put in, the entire area, including Phinney and Greenwood, became increasingly popular.","This area is the perfect mix of quiet neighborhood meets in-city energy. Phinney Avenue just begs to be strolled down and enjoyed. New eateries, coffee shops, and fun boutique shops are opening up all the time, and the Phinney Neighborhood Association keeps a steady string of community events on their calendar.","People from all over the city flock to Woodland Park and Woodland Park Zoo. Rumor has it, if you live on the edge of the park, you get two free passes to the summer ZooTunes concerts! Red Mill Burgers is a must-see, as is the PhinneyWood Art Walk. There also seem to be a high number of pet-related businesses; pets are welcome here!Of course, Green Lake is just a roll down the hill to the east, and Ballard is equally close to the west."
queen-anne,"If its name isn’t enough indication, the fact that this neighborhood can really be divided into four smaller ones should give you a clue as to how fancy and important it is.","Originally called Eden Hill, this neighborhood was one of the last to be completely developed because, well, it’s steep. As you can imagine, the base was the first to be built upon, but nobody really wanted to deal with trekking up to its top to build a home. In fact, land developers tried a “two-for-one” deal, where you could get two plots of land for the price of one if you built a house immediately. Can you imagine something like that happening today?! Once the issue of roads and transportation was solved, however, the area quickly populated. Sadly, no queen ever lived here. So many built Queen Anne style houses, the entire neighborhood adopted the name.","Well, it depends where you are on the Hill. Lower Queen Anne backs up to the Seattle Center (which includes the Space Needle, Key Arena, Science Center, etc.) and is close to all that downtown has to offer. East and West Queen Anne, which meet in the middle at the top of the hill, are both great residential areas that share a common business district along Queen Anne Avenue. North Queen Anne, which faces Fremont, is home to Seattle Pacific University and has a quieter feel.","Depending on who you ask, Lower Queen Anne may or may not include the Seattle Center, but let’s pretend for a moment that it does. In that case, there are about a gazillion events and attractions to keep you busy—Bumbershoot, Folk Life, IMAX theater, Children’s Theater, Key Arena (Rat City Rollergirls,or Seattle Stormanyone?), the Bite of Seattle, etc. etc. etc. Even if you eliminate that area, there are still tons of cool local restaurants and bars: Uptown Espresso, Ozzie’s Karaoke Bar, Peso’s, and Buckley’s sports-themed bar. Don’t even get me started!If this neighborhood had a central nervous system, Queen Anne Avenue would be the spinal cord; it runs straight through the middle and is where most of the important stuff happens. Up at the top of the hill, there are about 10 blocks’ worth of unique and charming places to peruse. Though there are great places to nosh—El Diablo (ask for your latte Cuban-style, with caramelized sugar), the famous How to Cook a Wolf, or the down-home 5 Spot with their rotating menu—there are many other things to do! Check out the stellar view of downtown Seattle and Mount Rainier from Kerry Park. Or relax and play a board game before you buy it at Blue Highway Games, where the motto is “Unplug and Reconnect.” Love it!"
wallingford,"If you’re like me, the word “Wallingford” brings to mind a snobbish million-dollar estate in England somewhere.  Well, forget it! The Seattle version of Wallingford is definitely not snobbish, nor will it cost you millions of dollars. But English accents are welcome.The neighborhood takes its name from a rich landowner who possessed almost the entire area from Green Lake down to Lake Union. It was annexed into the city in the 1890’s and began to grow once a trolley was built to connect downtown with Green Lake.","In 1906, a large industrial area was developed where coal was turned into gas–the area now known as Gasworks Park. Despite the fact that it spewed ash and sparks everywhere, the neighborhood continued to grow, attracting schools, businesses, and homes. By 1920, Wallingford was known as one of the more popular and fastest-growing spots in Seattle.","Wallingford has a nice mix of down-home, been-here-forever places (Dick’s Burgers and the Durn Good Grocery, for example) and trendy, hot-for-fall places, like Molly Moon ice cream and Tilth. The busiest area is along 45th Street, which is always bustling with activity as people visit the ever-changing lineup of restaurants, bars, and shops. Farther from the action lies the residential area with some pretty cool old homes.","As we mentioned earlier, there is tons to do along 45th Street. The Guild Theater, a two-screen cinema originally built in 1919, is still a popular attraction for moviegoers. Before the show, try out the Wallingford Pizza House for one of their famous “dome” pizzas–you have to see it to understand it. Afterwards, pop into Murphy’s Pub for a nightcap.The Wallingford Center, an old school building that was recently renovated to house apartments and retail spaces, is a big attraction. Year-round, head inside for a look-see around all of the gift shops, and make sure you grab a Trophy cupcake while you’re there!Gasworks Park is also a major landmark in the area. Learn a bit of history while touring the old plant, or maybe try your hand at kite-flying at the top of the hill. This is also a perfect place to hang out on the 4th of July, where you can picnic and watch the fireworks.Of course you can’t talk about Wallingford without giving a nod to that iconic QFC sign. They recently remodeled the building, but kept the sign. A good thing, too–otherwise The People may have revolted."
westlake,"The narrow strip of land along the western shore of Lake Union is aptly named Westlake, much like it’s brother to the east, Eastlake. Westlake is a major transportation corridor between downtown and North Seattle, filled with a mix of condos, apartments, offices, homes and houseboats.","The history of Westlake is inexorably linked to the growth of Seattle’s coal and timber industries along Lake Union. Transporting coal from Renton and Newcastle to ships on Elliott Bay eventually lead to construction of Seattle’s first railway along what is now Westlake Ave. A large lumber mill at the south end of Lake Union also fueled the need for transport along the lake. The Seattle Electric Railway extended its line to Fremont over a planked trestle hugging the western shore of Lake Union. That route still exists today as Westlake Ave, which was paved in 1906.","Westlake is a very narrow sliver of a neighborhood, sandwiched between Aurora Ave and Lake Union. Three major arterial roads cut through the neighborhood as the main routes from downtown to neighborhoods like Fremont, Ballard and Wallingford. Transport to and from downtown is easy, either via bus, car or bicycle.Westlake does house quite a few folks in a hodge-podge of accommodations. There are still 100 yr homes mixed in with more modern apartments and condos and even some townhomes. Like Eastlake, Westlake also houses a significant enclave of houseboat dwellers along the northwest shore of Lake Union.Despite its small size, Westlake is fairly crowded, with parking sometimes difficult on its crowded, narrow streets. It is also the land of urban condo/apartment dwellers with very few kids. There are also quite a few office buildings in this area, including some of Seattle’s most unique offices with parking spots for your boat underneath!","Westlake is home to a number of major attractions. The new South Lake Union Park is a great place to enjoy on a nice day, and from there it is a short hop to Kenmore Air and Argosy Cruises. You can also rent an electric boat or hot tub boat. The first Sunday of the month brings the infamous pancake breakfast at the Swedish Cultural Center.Lake Union has always been heavy with commercial activity. The lumber and coal transport along Westlake Ave has been changed to marinas, boat maintenance and yacht brokers. If you are looking to pilfer your retirement savings for a boat, you’ll likely end up at an establishment along Westlake.While Westlake is very urban and convenient, it doesn’t have much in the way of restaurants or stores of its own. It is convenient to the hotspots in Fremont, Queen Anne, Eastlake and South Lake Union, however."
whittier-heights,This small residential section of Ballard is ideal for people who love the vibe of northwest Seattle but want a slightly quieter place to call home.,"Much like other nearby subdivisions like Loyal Heights and Sunset Hill, Whittier Heights was only moved into once the housing options in downtown Ballard had filled up. The biggest era for growth was 1920 through 1940, when most of the houses were built. In more recent years, some new homes have been built, leaving the neighborhood with a nice mix of the vintage and the modern.","Whittier Heights is an unassuming residential neighborhood, basking quietly in the glow of its bigger sister, Ballard. The streets here are in a straightforward grid pattern, which furthers the notion that it’s a no-frills, no-nonsense place to live. On the outer edges of the neighborhood there are some fun pockets of businesses that offer nice alternatives to the main drag in Ballard.","One of the most charming places to explore in Whittier Heights is the area along 65th street at its southern border. This mini business district has a surprising variety of establishments, from dive bars like The Tin Hat to shoe shops (The Sneakery). Word has it that The Dray is a great place to watch soccer (I mean ‘football’) and sample some obscure beers. You can also get a tattoo at Slave to the Needle or check out Babalouise, the local salon.Further into the ‘heart’ of Whittier are a few other gems. People are raving about Honore Bakery and their French-inspired goods. Delancey pizza also deserves a nod for its wood-fired and unique pies. Just get ready to wait in line at both of these places!"
beacon-hill,"The giant tract of land south of downtown between I-5 and Rainier Valley is known as Beacon Hill, easy to find because of the old veteran’s hospital that sits atop its peak. Despite its close proximity to downtown and First Hill, Beacon Hill has a vibe all its own.","The key to Beacon Hill is its seclusion from the surrounding areas. This was a problem at first; no one was willing to move to the hill that was just slightly too far away. Eventually the hill was re-graded, making the area more accessible. When a trolley line was finally put in, many immigrants flocked to the neighborhood to farm and sell their produce to others.In 1909, a jail was built and inmates could “work off” part of their sentence by helping to clear the land for Jefferson park. And when the US Army warplanes came to Seattle in 1918, they had no airport at which to land, so they used this very park as their runway. This prompted the city to build Boeing field at the base of Beacon Hill.","Depending upon where you are on Beacon Hill, you’ll get a different feel for the neighborhood. The busiest section is on the north end, especially whereBeacon Hill meets the Rainier Valley. Up at the top of the hill, things settle down into a nice residential area with a small business district. The farther south you go, the more secluded and quiet things get.","Though Beacon Hill is largely residential, there are several pockets of activity in different areas. Beacon Avenue runs the length of the hill, and if you travel from north to south, you’ll get a great view of downtown and then reach a small area with restaurants and stores near 15th Avenue. Stop at The Station for coffee, or Delite Bakery—one of the favorite spots for residents here. If you keep heading south, you’ll go through Jefferson Park, which has a golf course, hiking trails, tennis courts, and kid-friendly play equipment.Along Rainier Avenue on the east side of the hill, there is an abundance of places to check out. Go bowling at Imperial Lanes or grab food at one of the many ethnic restaurants that line the street."
columbia-city,"Everyone’s buzzing about Columbia City these days, and a quick tour through the cozy residential area or a stroll through the business district makes it easy to see why!","Named after Christopher Columbus, this neighborhood aspired to be great from its beginning. With a sawmill that could make neat work of the area’s giant trees and a rail line that connected to Downtown Seattle, Columbia City was a popular place to settle in the late 1800s. With its many businesses and services, it was even considered a downtown to the smaller communities nearby.After World War II, the neighborhood saw a decline. Businesses closed, and crime rates rose. In the past few decades, however, many efforts have successfully spruced things up and attracted residents once again.","Columbia City has the highestWalk Scoreof any neighborhood south of downtown, including the ever-popular “Junction” in West Seattle. Translation: there’s a lot to do here, and it’s all concentrated in one area. The people here love to support the local businesses. For example, I talked to a guy working at a little boutique who not only lived in the neighborhood but also bartended at the pub next door. In fact, he may have just been filling in at the shop as a favor to the owner. The point is: people get along harmoniously herein Columbia City.","To experience Columbia City’s charm, head to Rainier Avenue where it meets Genesee Street. Park your car, and spend some time moseying up and down the main drag and side streets. If you’re early enough, sit at Geraldine’s Counter and have some amazing pancakes, or try Columbia City Bakery for one of their famous pastries. Places like Columbia City Bouquet,Andaluz, and Retroactive Kids provide great browsing opportunities. Round out the day with a show at Columbia City Theatre and dinner at one of the many restaurants to choose from.If you’re up for a little more activity, head to Genesee Park and enjoy the many acres of open grass, play fields, and jungle gyms. Or do a little bike shopping at Bike Works, where they teach youth to fix up used bikes and sell them to you at a great price!"
georgetown,"This blossoming neighborhood in south Seattle is attracting people who want to live close to downtown but might not have the financial means to live in certain other areas. With its quirky culture and fun hangouts, Georgetown is really making a name for itself.","When pioneers first came to the area in the 1850s, Georgetown was one of the places they settled. Then, it was right along the Duwamish river, a fertile valley great for growing hops and other crops. The first railroad began here in 1875, connecting Tacoma and Seattle. Because of its many taverns, which were prohibited in the city, and the Rainier Brewery, Georgetown was a destination for many Seattleites looking to unwind.The neighborhood has long been industrialized and not very resident-friendly, but starting in the 1970s, that has slowly changed. Artists moved in to take advantage of cheap loft spaces, old brick buildings have been turned into cool living quarters, and a delightful little business district has developed.","One’s initial reaction when driving into Georgetown might be, “Where the *bleep* am I?” But then you start to notice things: amidst the sprawling warehouses, an oasis of humanity. Around the area of Airport Way and Corson Avenue begins a strip of businesses that are as funky as they are hidden. To the south and west lies the residential area, containing modest homes and apartment buildings.","In keeping with tradition, there are still some great taverns in Georgetown; 9 Lb. Hammer, Jules Maes Saloon, and the Marco Polo Bar and Grill to name a few. And even though the Rainier brewery is no longer in operation, several new ones have cropped up, like Georgetown Brewery with their ever-popular Manny’s, and Emerald City Beer, who specializes in a lager called Dottie. For food, tryTwo Tartes bakery for a sandwich and giant cookie (get the Georgetown Mojo—chocolate chip, coconut, and oatmeal), or Stellar Pizza for delicious pies made from local ingredients.If you’re not hungry or thirsty, hit up Mix lounge for live music, Georgetown Records for tunes that can go home with you, or hit up one of the many antique stores or art galleries for some eye candy. Check out Georgetown Trailer Park Mall, a lot full of vintage trailers selling goods ranging from eccentric to nostalgic – open every Friday-Sunday. The most daring can go to School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts (SANCA) to learn the art of the flying trapeze or tumbling."
mount-baker,"If you’ve ever traveled west on the I-90 bridge heading into the city of Seattle, you’ve probably noticed some impressive homes and waterfront parks ahead of you before you enter the tunnel. This is the Mount Baker neighborhood, and it’s even more impressive from the inside.","Once it was finally cleared of its trees and was made accessible to the rest of the city by trolley, Mount Baker quickly became an upscale neighborhood. A community club was formed and the wealthy landowners who built their houses in the area were granted membership. With its views of Lake Washington, the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges, and Mount Baker in the distance (hence the name), people were eager to move in.Though it is still one of the fancier residential neighborhoods, Mount Baker has lost much of its elite attitude. People flock here during the summer to watch the SeaFair hydroplane races and to visit nearby Columbia City and Seward Park.","The atmosphere around here is pretty quiet, especially on the Lake Washington side; you’d never guess you were in the middle of a huge city. Farther west, along Rainier Avenue, things are a bit busier, with block after block of businesses. With the recent addition of the light rail station, people can more easily commute in and out of downtown.","It would be hard to find a more scenic place to run or bike than along Lake Washington Boulevard, and many people come here to do just that (In fact, on Bicycle Sundays they closethe boulevard to car traffic, so it’s available only to bikers and walkers). The road and trail connect several parks along the waterfront, and swimming, boating, or kayaking opportunities abound. Sayers Memorial Park takes up a tiny peninsula of land and connects to the beautiful Genesee Park, which rambles through the neighborhood and eventually ends in Columbia City. The Community Clubhouse holds events for whoever wishes to come. Choices include fitness day, bingo night, lectures, and workshops for both kids and adults.Noteworthy dining establishments include Emerald City Fish and Chips, That’s Amore! Italian Café (made even better by the stunning view), and Repast Bakery. Of course, along Rainier Avenue there are about a gazillion options, from fast food to cuisine from many ethnicities."
rainier-beach,Rainier Beach is yet another south Seattle neighborhood that is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Its affordable houses and beautiful views are just a few of its draws.,"In the early days, the landscape here was ideal for farming, hunting, and logging. Developers recognized a good thing when the saw it and cleared land for houses. In fact, the same man that put Green Lake on the map also had a hand in luring people to Rainier Beach. He created Atlantic City Park, now known as Beer Sheva Park. Rail lines connecting Seattle to Renton also helped draw people into the area.During World War II, housing developments were made to accommodate war workers, and after the war these became low-income residences. In the years that followed the war, crime rates rose and people left the neighborhood. Towards the end of the century, however, new houses were built, and those who were looking for affordable options moved in. Since then, the neighborhood has seen growth and prosperity.","A peek at the calendar of events on the Rainier Valley Post Blog shows that this is an organized community who takes great pride in the diversity of the neighborhood. To name a few popular events: International Music and Arts Festival, Big Day of Play, community clean-up days, and the Summer Streets Block Party and Heritage Parade. So even though the residential area is on the quiet side, it’s clear that Rainier Beach can be a place to be out and about, too.","The best attractions here involve nature’s splendor. Beer Shiva Park and Pritchard Island Beach fuse together and provide two great sunbathing sites. Farther south is Lakeridge Park, a 35 acre wooded area with flowing water, hiking trails, and shade galore. At the top of the hill in the center of Rainier Beach lies the Kubota Garden, a historical site and magnificent display of landscape architecture. Paths meander amongst native plants, crossing over small streams with footbridges or stepping stones."
seward-park,"In southeast Seattle, a small peninsula of land juts out into Lake Washington. This is Seward Park, and the surrounding neighborhood shares the same name.","The first settlers here in the 1850s were farmers, orchard tenders, and loggers. The nearby sawmill drew in many workers, and the population steadily increased. It wasn’t until a trolley line was built in 1891 that people could start developing the land in earnest. Where views of the lake were to be had, impressive homes were built, and more modest ones filled in the lots that were farther back from the water. When the neighborhood was annexed into Seattle in the early 1900s, the land on the peninsula was purchased by the city and turned into a park, which they named after William Seward. (You know—Seward’s Folly? Alaska? Ring a bell?) Anyway, eventually the whole neighborhood took on the name of the park.","There are two distinct areas to Seward Park: the water side, and the Rainier Avenue side. The part facing the water is largely residential, with neat rows of houses and a quiet, homey feel. On the Rainier Avenue side you’ll find the businesses and activity. Around here, there’s a lot to do and you’re only a few blocks away from other hip neighborhoods like Columbia City and Rainier Beach.","Between Seward Park the park and Seward Park the neighborhood, there is so much to do here. The park has a 2.5-mile paved trail that runs the border of the peninsula, as well as regular old hiking trails that criss-cross through the middle. There are swimming areas, boat launches, playgrounds, and an environmental learning center. Rumor has it that many bald eagles have made their nests here, so if you keep your eyes peeled, you just might spot one!The business district to the west also has a lot to offer. Flying Squirrel Pizza Company, recently featured by Seattle Metropolitan magazine, had its first restaurant here in Seward Park. Other neighborhood gems include Caffe Vita coffee and Zesto burgers."
south-park,"No, this isn’t the South Park depicted on Comedy Central. Instead of seeing the Rocky Mountains in the background, here you’ll see the Duwamish River and the Seattle skyline.","This area was an ideal place to settle in Seattle’s early days. With the Duwamish River meandering through, the land was fertile and farming was lucrative. When the need for shipping canals increased, the river was straightened and deepened, and farms started closing down and giving way to industrial endeavors. The community has fought to maintain some sense of community throughout history, and although South Park isn’t the fertile valley that it once was, it still holds its appeal for many.","In the past decade or so, South Park has seen a time of refreshing changes. The Duwamish Waterway Park was built along the river and Cesar Chavez Park provides a place to enjoy sculptures and local art. New housing options have been built, and the older ones are gradually being spruced up. Businesses have been moving into the area as a response to the new population growth. All in all, good things are in the future in South Park.","As with nearby Georgetown, South Park is a haven for breweries and wineries.Lowercase Brewing specializes in “Simple, good beer” while Odin Brewing “embraces the exploratory spirit of the ancient Vikings” with their beers. O S Winery hosts tastings of their own specialty wines and also hosts private events; Nota Bene Cellars is a family-owned operation that specializes in red wines made from Washington grapes.Loretta’s Northwesterner is a local favorite, serving up beers and burgers and always playing the latest game on one of their many televisions. Possibly the best part is that they have an Airstream trailer out back where you can hang out and watch more TV. Sweet!"
west-seattle,"Though it’s isolated from the rest of the city, West Seattle is an incredibly popular area, whether it’s to live in or just to visit one of its hip neighborhoods.","The first European settlers landed in West Seattle in 1851 and attempted to set up there, an endeavor that was made difficult by poor weather and a harbor that wasn’t quite up to par. A few stayed behind while everyone else moved on to Elliot Bay. From then on, West Seattle was its own unique community and has maintained a different attitude than Seattle as a whole.The community only really agreed to be annexed into Seattle out of necessity; they just couldn’t get their roads and public utilities up to the level of quality that they wanted. In 1907, West Seattle became part of Seattle officially, but at several times throughout history they threatened to back out of the deal, even as recently as the 1990s. Let’s all keep our fingers crossed that the idea doesn’t come up again; it would be a shame to take this neighborhood off the list of Seattle’s fine districts.","On a nice day, Alki couldn’t be a better destination. The activities there are endless, ranging from simply jogging to the more adventurous kite surfing or parasailing. There are other parks that may be less popular but are every bit as worthwhile, such as Schmitz, Mee Kwa Mooks, and Lincoln parks.You could probably spend every day for a week exploring all that California Avenue and Admiral Way have to offer. You can find anything here; music stores, bakeries, bars, salons, and thrift stores just to name a few. A lot of the businesses are unique to West Seattle; in other words, there aren’t many chains here!",
admiral,"At the heart of West Seattle, Admiral is a neighborhood that combines a beautiful residential area with ultra-hip businesses and unique culture.","After early settlers wrote off Alki beach as too harsh, they moved to the more civilization-friendly top of the hill. This became the business and commercial district of the town of West Seattle, while more residential areas cropped up in the surrounding area. Admiral attempted to annex these smaller neighborhoods without success. All of the communities worked together to get bridges and roads put in so that West Seattle would be more accessible by Seattle residents. In this they did succeed, especially if you count the ferry that crossed Puget Sound in a record eight minutes.There was much argument about whether West Seattle should be annexed into Seattle Proper, and it finally happened in 1907. Still, because of its geographic separation from the rest of the city, West Seattle has a distinct culture, and Admiral remains the center of it all.","A quick perusal at the Admiral Neighborhood Association website give you a glimpse into what the vibe of the community is. They claim to be “comprised of residents, business people, and others who care about the environmental, economic, and social sustainability” of the neighborhood. And care, they do. Events like clean-up days, outdoor concerts, community forums, and art walks get everyone involved and feeling like part of something bigger.","The main streets here are Admiral Way and California Avenue, and the intersection of the two is a great place to start an exploration of the region. Whether you have small children in your life or not, you simply must stop at Max and Quinn’s Atomic Boys Shop-o-Rama, which is full of some of the funnest toys you’ll ever see; think robots, zombies, and pretty much anything retro. Keep the vintage feel going by catching a film at the Historic Admiral Theaters, where they show second-release films for only $6—beat that!Traveling south on California, you’ll come across other gems like Freshy’s Coffee and Tea, The Heartland Cafe (don’t miss the Benbow Room … it’s like you just stepped into the hull of a Pirate ship), and Prost! German pub. If you make it that far, the intersection of California and Alaska (aka “The Junction”) is another extremely popular area of West Seattle, and though not technically part of Admiral, still worth some major exploration time."
alki,"If you take your cues from baby seals, you’ll soon be turning up on Alki Beach to enjoy the long stretch of sand and view of downtown. In Seattle, this is as close as you can get to living in beachy paradise.","Apparently early European settlers took their cues from baby seals, because Alki was the very first place they stopped in Puget Sound in 1851. The view was quite different back then when they were greeted by none other than Chief Seattle. Imagine—no Space Needle, no Century Link Field, no piers or ferry terminals! The conditions were rather unforgiving, and they named the settlement New York-Alki. “Alki” means “by-and-by” or “In a while” in Chinook, so apparently no one was expecting the place to be a booming metropolis anytime soon.It didn’t take long for people to move to Elliot Bay, where the weather and harbor were a little more forgiving. The few people who stayed (only two families) dropped the “New York” from the name and kept the Alki, liking its laid-back sound. Eventually even those families bailed on the area, and Alki was left empty while the rest of West Seattle populated. It wasn’t until neighborhoods like Admiral and Fauntleroy were well established that Alki saw action again, this time as a public beach and a resort area for the wealthy.","As with the rest of West Seattle, Alki has a relaxed feeling, and you can tell the residents are ultra-proud of their ‘hood. Visitors covet the beachfront condos and the place is packed during the summer for beach volleyball tournaments and picnics. In the off-season, locals claim their neighborhood once again.","I’m not kidding about the baby seal thing. It’s not uncommon to go for a walk along Alki Beach and come across one of the little guys, and signs posted will be sure to tell you leave them alone. Instead, view from afar while walking, biking, or blading on the boardwalk (you can rent equipment at Wheel Fun Rentals) or just plain sunbathing. Or, if the beach is too packed, try one of the local parks like Whale Tale Park, Bar S Playground, or the Charles Richey viewpoint.At mealtime, grab fish and chips at Spud and eat it picnic-style, or stop in to Pegasus Pizza, Cactus, or Phoenicia for indoor beachside dining."
fauntleroy,"The area in southwest West Seattle, Fauntleroy, is secluded and quiet with incredible views. The ferry terminal and a large waterfront park keep people coming in all year round.","Fauntleroy got its start when railroad developers randomly built a line there in 1907, which was interesting because no one really lived there. A donation from real estate developers probably was the reason this was chosen as a destination. Sure enough, as soon as the train started running, the neighborhood began to boom.Lincoln Park was built in 1908 as part of the citywide parks plan, and in 1920 the ferry terminal was put in to connect West Seattle to Vashon Island.","Considering its relative isolation from the busier parts of Seattle, it’s no surprise that the vibe in Fauntleroy is mellow. The place is quiet and serene—how could it not be with such great views of the nearby islands and the Olympic Mountains? But there is one thing that people get fired up about around here: environmentalism. Residents work tirelessly to protect the natural habitats along the waterfront and Fauntleroy Creek. They are always conscious of the way the ferry terminal and human activity affect the area’s parks and wildlife. So if there’s one reason why they like to keep it quiet around here, it’s probably so that the environment will remain beautiful for future generations.","Lincoln Park, just north of the ferry terminal, claims to be Seattle’s most ‘multipurpose’ park, boasting amenities like hiking trails, bike trails, boat launch, wading pool, heated outdoor saltwater pool, ball fields, and picnic sites. Oh yeah, and horseshoe pits, play equipment, a sweet view, and a p-patch. Phew! I guess they weren’t exaggerating!There isn’t any major business district here, but there are a few noteworthy restaurants: try out Birds on a Wire Espresso, the funky neighborhood coffee shop, Endolyne Joe’s for their ‘tour of the Americas’ menu that rotates every season, or The Original Bakery for a donut that would rival any of the more famous shops in Seattle.If none of that suffices, you can always jump on the Vashon or Southworth ferry; both leave from the terminal at Fauntleroy Cove."
alaska-junction,"The West Seattle Junction may be the only intersection in Seattle where pedestrians can walk all ways across the street when they get the signal. If these things are any indication of the hipness of a neighborhood, one can deduce that the Junction must be one of the coolest places to live in Seattle, right?","People certainly agreed with that sentiment in the early 1900s. When two streetcar lines were finally constructed in 1907 along Alaska Street and California Avenue, their intersection—the Junction—was developed faster than any neighborhood in Seattle’s history. Times got tough during the great depression in the 1930s, but soon rebounded with the advent of the automobile. This was when the All Way Walk signal made its debut—too many cars were competing with too many pedestrians. And although there were a few more blips in the neighborhood’s success here and there, it’s safe to say that today, West Seattle is established and here to stay.","The Junction is considered to be downtown West Seattle, and according to the community website, this is “Where It’s At.” And by ‘it,’ they probably mean: shopping, dining, drinking, desserting, concert going, coffee sipping, wine tasting, farmers-marketing, and on and on and on. Events like art walks, seasonal festivals, open mic nights, and outdoor movie nights keep locals and visitors busy all year round.The neighborhood actually goes by a few names these days. You may hear it called,or simply. Technically there is a neighborhood to the west called Genessee, though it overlaps and many residents will simply say they live in “The Junction.”","Some establishments worth mentioning are the Husky Deli, which has been selling groceries and ice cream since the 1930s, Easy Street Records, a funky new-and-used music shop that also serves up a cheap and delicious brunch, and Bakery Noveau, which took over the space of a historic bakery. Really, there’s no shortage of shops and eateries to pop into; it all depends on what you’re in the mood for!Maybe you’re in the mood for something a little more active than dining and shopping. In that case, the Junction is also home to one of the only bowling alleys left in the city—West Seattle Bowl. Or, to get out in nature, check out Camp Long and its hiking trails, climbing rocks and newly constructed ropes course."
